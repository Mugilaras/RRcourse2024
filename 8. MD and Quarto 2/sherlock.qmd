# Viewership Trend Over Time

We can analyze the trend of viewership over the series' episodes and seasons.

```{python}

sherlock_df = pd.DataFrame(sherlock_data)

# Display the DataFrame to check it's correct
sherlock_df

# Plotting the viewership trend over the episodes
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(sherlock_df['No. overall'], sherlock_df['Viewers (millions) UK'], marker='o', linestyle='-')
plt.title('Viewership Trend of Sherlock (UK)')
plt.xlabel('Episode Number')
plt.ylabel('Viewers (millions) UK')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

# Episode-to-Episode Viewership Changes

We will now look at how viewership changed from one episode to the next.

```{python}
# Calculating the change in viewership between episodes
sherlock_df['Viewership Change UK'] = sherlock_df['Viewers (millions) UK'].diff()

# Plotting

# the viewership change
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.bar(sherlock_df['No. overall'], sherlock_df['Viewership Change UK'], color='lightblue')
plt.title('Episode-to-Episode Viewership Changes in Sherlock (UK)')
plt.xlabel('Episode Number')
plt.ylabel('Change in Viewers (millions) UK')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

# Conclusion

The provided data shows a strong start for *Sherlock* with a significant viewership in the UK. Although we have incomplete data for the US viewership, the UK trends indicate a consistent interest in the show, particularly during its second series, which saw higher numbers.
